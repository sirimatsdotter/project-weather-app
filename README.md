# Weather App

This weeks project was to build a weather site from a weather API to include both current weather and a 5 day forecast, and make sure it was mobile first but also responsive on other devices. 

## The problem
We spent most of the time figuring out how to get the data from the two API's and how to make conditional formatting based on the data. We struggled a bit with how to understand how to access parts of the data (which was in an array). We googled a lot :)
We decided to not create our own design, but to try to accomplish the Design 2 that we were handed. 

# If we had more time we would...
- We would have liked to add in some animations for the weather icons or own images
- Add more cities to choose from
